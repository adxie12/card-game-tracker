# My Personal Project - *Yu-Gi-Oh!* Trading Card Game Tracker

## Project Description

<p> My project is an application that can track the results of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> matches. <br>
In this application, the user will be able to add the result and details of a match to a list of matches. <br>
The user will also be able to view the list of matches and their results. The user will also be able to enter detailed information about their matches, including, but not limited to:</p>

- Date the match was played
- The type of deck the user played
- The type of deck the user's opponent played
- The name of the opponent
- Which games in the match were won/lost/drawn
- Whether or not the user won the die roll
- Notable moments and/or details about the match

With this data in mind, the user will be able to view and manipulate the data to show various statistics, such as:

- Win rate while playing a certain deck
- Win rate while playing against a certain deck
- Win rate against a particular opponent
- Win rate in Games 1, 2, and 3 of matches
- Win rate depending on winning or losing the die roll
- Percentage of matches drawn
- A combination of the above

This application will be used by any <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> players who want to keep track of their match history and who are interested in their match statistics.
This project is of interest to me as I am an avid competitive <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> player who would be personally interested in using such an application.
